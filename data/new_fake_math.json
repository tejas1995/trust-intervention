        "question": "Consider a system of n nonlinear partial differential equations represented by ∇⋅(∇u) + αu^2 + βu³ = 0, where u(x, y, z) is an unknown function defined in the bounded domain Ω ⊆ ℝ³. The boundary ∂Ω is a smooth surface. The system is subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions on ∂Ω, given by u(x, y, z) = f(x, y, z), where f(x, y, z) is a known function. Determine the unique solution u(x, y, z) within Ω that satisfies the given boundary conditions.",
        "answer1": "By formulating the problem as a variational one, we minimize the functional J(u) = ∫Ω (∇u)² + αu² + βu³ dx dy dz, subject to u(x, y, z) = f(x, y, z) on ∂Ω. Applying the Euler-Lagrange equation yields a system of nonlinear partial differential equations. Numerical methods like finite element analysis or finite difference methods can provide an approximate solution.",
        "answer2": "Solving the nonlinear partial differential equations analytically is infeasible. Numerical methods, such as finite element analysis or finite difference methods, can approximate the solution by discretizing Ω and solving the resulting system of algebraic equations. The accuracy depends on the mesh size and numerical scheme used."

        "answer1": "Outliers can significantly impact the mean since they have a substantial effect on the sum of the observations. They tend to pull the mean towards their extreme values. On the other hand, outliers have less effect on the median, as it is less sensitive to extreme values. Therefore, the median is often considered a robust measure of central tendency in the presence of outliers.",

A larger absolute value of the coefficient indicates a stronger influence on the response variable. Additionally, conducting hypothesis tests or computing effect sizes can provide further insights into the relative importance of predictors.",
